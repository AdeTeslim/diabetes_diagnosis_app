# 🩺 Diabetes Diagnosis ML App

Welcome to my first served Machine Learning application!  
This project is a web-based diabetes diagnosis tool built using **Streamlit** and a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model.  
The app allows users to input medical data and receive predictions about the risk of diabetes based on a trained model.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This application predicts whether a patient has:

- 🟢 **No Diabetes**
- 🟡 **Possible Risk of Diabetes**
- 🔴 **Confirmed Diabetes**

...based on features such as **age**, **HbA1c levels**, **BMI**, and more.

The model was trained on a dataset (`Dataset of Diabetes.csv`) using an **SVM with an RBF kernel**, including **class weighting** to handle imbalance.

## 🎯 Features

- 🔘 Interactive input form with sliders for medical data entry  
- 🤖 Real-time prediction using a pre-trained SVM model  
- 📊 Display of prediction probabilities for transparency  
- 🐞 Debug outputs to assist with troubleshooting  

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Git (for cloning the repository)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdeTeslim/diabetes_diagnosis_app.git
cd diabetes_diagnosis_app
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download the Dataset

Place the `Dataset of Diabetes.csv` file in the project directory.  
You can obtain this dataset from the original source or use the sample provided in the project documentation.

---

## 📦 Save the Model and Scaler

Ensure the trained `svm_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` files are in the project directory.  
These can be generated by running the .ipynb script below.

---

## 🛠️ Usage

### ▶️ Run the .ipynb Script (optional)

If you need to train the model:

```bash
# Open manually in Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook svm_diabetes_diagnosis.ipynb
```

### ▶️ Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run streamlitapp.py
```

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) to use the app.  
Enter medical values using the sliders and click **Diagnose** to see the prediction.

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 95% on test set  
- **F1-score (Confirmed Diabetes)**: 0.97  
- **F1-score (Possible Risk)**: 0.60 *(due to class imbalance)*

See `svm_diabetes_diagnosis.ipynb` for detailed metrics and the confusion matrix.
